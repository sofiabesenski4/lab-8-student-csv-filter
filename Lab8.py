Lab8.py
this program will take a csv formatted file as input, and stdout an altered csv file

Each line in the file needs to contain: 
				"first_name,last_name,age,course1,â€¦courseN" of university students
The goal is to return a csv table of students who are over the age of 25 in the form:
				"LASTNAME,firstname,int(number of courses)"
The implementation required, is to create a dictionary for every student in the file, then add to a list of student dictionaries.
After that, use lambda, map and filter functions to retrieve only students over age 25, and format the output according to the specifications noted
